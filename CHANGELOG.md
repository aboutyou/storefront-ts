# Changelog

### Unreleased

- Export `BasketItemPrice` and `BasketTotalPrice` ([28](https://gitlab.com/aboutyou/cloud-core/backbone-ts/-/merge_requests/28))
  - Thanks to [@sqonde](https://gitlab.com/sqonde) for contributing this fix

### 8.0.0

- The `axios` library is now a peer dependency, so you can specify the version to be used in the consumer's `package.json`.
- `depth` is now exposed on the category response type
- `skipAvailabilityCheck` can now be specified for basket requests

### 7.0.0

- `BapiClient`: Change the default `shopID` placement to be `query`, which avoids `CORS` `OPTIONS` requests for `GET` requests.

### 6.0.0

- Align the parameters across `BapiClient.categories.*` methods

  - The `depth` parameter is now send to BAPI in all cases, even though it's not needed for every case (e.g. requesting categories by IDs wouldn't include children, unless those where specified using the `with` parameter). This is done to have a consistent behavior across the SDK methods, and not be reliant on per endpoint behavior in BAPI.
  - The legacy behavior of not returning the whole category tree by default when requesting the root categories (`BapiClient.categories.getRoots`) is kept. Pass an explicit `children` parameter (e.g. `1000`) to request the whole tree.
  - `BapiClient.categories.getByIds` and `createCategoriesByIdsEndpointRequest` used to take a `depth` parameter which mapped directly to the BAPI HTTP API `depth` parameter. This has now been removed in favor of `with.children`, which specifies the additional levels of children that should be loaded. Set `with.children` to `"previous depth" - 1` when upgrading to this version.

- Adds support for the `/filters/:groupName/values` endpoint

### 5.0.0

- Remove support for `/masters` endpoint

### 4.1.1

- Add `minProductId` to `ProductsSearchEndpointParameters`

### 4.1.0

- Add `variants.getByIds` to `BapiClient`

### 4.0.1

- Fix types for the `BapiProductCategory` and `BapiCategory`

### 4.0.0

- Removal of the following product helpers: `findBrand`, `attributeLabel`, `variantAttributeLabel`, `variantAttributeId`, `attributeNames` and `labelFromAttributeGroup`
- Addition of the following helpers: `getAttributeValues`

These helpers have been removed because they were not very useful by themselves. With the new optional chaining operator, most of these operations can be performed inline in the code.

For more information, see: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#optional-chaining

### 3.0.1

Fix `ObjectMap` type usage, such that it's included in the final output package.

A `childShopId` parameter can now be passed to "add to basket" calls, which will be forward as `appId` in the payload of the checkout call.

The shop ID can now be set via the header or via an URL query parameter.  
Since it the URL parameter doesn't infere with CORS it's now mandatory in the SDK (and also in upcoming versions of the BAPI itself).  
The `execute` function by default will place the shop ID in the URL, while the `BapiClient` will place the shop ID in the header to support existing BAPI installations. This might change in the future.

## 0.16.0

Make the `shopId` optional, for cases where only a single shop ID is used and one wants to avoid CORS OPTIONS request in browser settings.

## 0.15.0

Send explicit `depth` parameter for all `/categories` requests. To request the whole category tree use an explicit depth exceeding the tree depth.
